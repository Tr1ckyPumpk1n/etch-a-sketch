# etch-a-sketch

### Description

This project is a remake of the classic drawing toy but with a modern touch. The User-Interface is different from the drawing toy but it is very user-friendly and different from what people usually make (and a better rainbow mode).


#### Features
- A resizable grid which can have from 4 to 64 (for performance) pixels / tiles to draw.
- A color picker which lets the user pick and use whatever the user desires.
- A ranbow mode that leaves a color trail of the light spectrum. Not random colors.
- A darken mode that darkens the color of the current pixel by 10% each time the user paints it or moves over it.
- A lighten mode that does the opposite of darken mode and lighten the color on the tile by 10%.
- An option to toggle grid lines if needed (turned off by default).
- A clear button that will clear the grid according to the theme.
- An eraser to erase the color.
- A dark mode switch that switches between light and dark mode.
